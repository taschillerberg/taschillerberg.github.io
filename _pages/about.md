I am a PhD student in the Department of Crop, Soils, and Enviornmental Science at Auburn University. Where I am advised by [Di Tian](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~dzt0025/). My research interest is analyzing climate impact on agriculture and food security, climate resilient agriculture and food systems, and utility of data analytics in climate and agriculture.

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my Bachelor of Science (Meteorology) at Iowa State University. My Master's was also completed at Auburn University where I was advised by Di Tian. My theis is titled "Assessing changes and predictability of crop yields and failure risk in the United States: The Impact from Large-scale Climate Circulations."

Pardon the mess, this is currently a  work in progress.
