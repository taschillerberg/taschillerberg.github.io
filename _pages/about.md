Tayler is a Ph.D. Candidate in the interdisciplinary Earth System Science program at Auburn University in the [Hydroclimate Research Group](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~dzt0025/). Tayler's research has focused on climate risks and agroclimatology, the study of the impacts of climate on agriculture. Areas of interest are climate impacts on agriculture and food security, climate resilient systems focusing on agriculture and food systems, and exposure to climate extremes. Because of the nature of these interests, Tayler has not shied away from Big Data, programming challenges, HPC systems, machine learning, and so many more statistical techniques she continues to gather knowledge on. 

Tayler's interest in agriculture and climate stems from her childhood. She started connecting the dots that a changing climate will affect her community, which is composed mainly of rainfed agriculture producers, expanding to global producers and food security. When not contemplating climate impacts, Tayler enjoys being creative in multiple mediums, such as painting and pottery. Staying active, she has run three half-marathons and aims to convince others to join the fun side of the running community: long runs.
