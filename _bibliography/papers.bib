abstract = {In this study, we aim to characterize synchronized global crop failures using remote sensing-based products, analyze their predictability and relationships with agroclimatic conditions using machine learning, and identify trends of the most influential agroclimatic indices revealed by machine learning over global croplands. We found that global synchronous crop failures showed strong interannual variability during 1982 to 2016. The most extreme global synchronous crop failure events occurred over 40% of global croplands in the years 2002 (rice and wheat) and 2012 (maize and soy), which had drier and warmer conditions compared to the normal years. Crop failure events can be accurately predicted using machine learning with agroclimatic indices. Of the four crops for both temperate and tropic regions, soy crop failure is most accurately predicted, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.8991 for the temperate region and 0.7892 for the tropics. The AUC score of maize failure in the temperate region is 0.8760, followed by wheat failure (0.8627) and rice failure (0.8025). In the tropics, the remaining crops performed similarly, with AUC scores of 0.7298 (maize), 0.7313 (rice), and 0.7337 (wheat). The machine learning model revealed that growing degree days, last spring frost, first fall frost, growing season precipitation, and optimal field conditions (represented by soil moisture) are the most influential agroclimatic indices, showing various nonlinear relationships with crop failure probabilities. The most influential agroclimatic indices present significant trends on more than 25% of global croplands, showing increasing growing degree days, earlier last spring frost, later first fall frost, while growing season precipitation and optimal field conditions are increasing. Our findings may inform food security predictions, selections of weather index for crop insurance, and climate adaptations.}

	title = {Changes of crop failure risks in the United States associated with large-scale climate oscillations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans},
	journal = {Environmental Research Letters},
	abstract = {Regions that produce a large supply of agriculture commodities can be susceptible to crop failure, thus causing concern for global food security. The contiguous United States, as one of the major agricultural producers in the world, is influenced by several large-scale climate oscillations that contribute to climate variability: Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Pacific-North American (PNA). Since local weather conditions are associated with these climate oscillations through teleconnections, they are potentially causing changes of crop failure risks. The objective of this study is to assess climate-induced changes of annual crop failure risks for maize and winter wheat from 1960 to 2016, by analyzing the associations of large-scale climate oscillations with the frequency of crop failure in the rainfed regions of the United States using a Bayesian approach. The analysis revealed that crop failure frequencies showed contrast spatial patterns and different extent under different climate oscillation phases. Among individual oscillations, the positive PNA and negative AMO resulted in the most substantial increase in maize and winter wheat crop failures over a high percentage of climate divisions, respectively. Among oscillation combinations, the positive AMO and negative PDO and the positive AMO and positive PDO resulted in the highest percentage of climate divisions experiencing significant increase of maize and winter wheat crop failures, respectively. Random forest models with climate oscillations accurately predicted probabilities of crop failure, with the inclusion of local surface climate variables decreased or increased the predictive accuracy, depending on regions. These results revealed the plausible drivers of long-term changes of U.S. crop failure risks and underscore the importance for improving climate oscillation forecasting for early warning of food insecurity.}

	abstract = {Studies have shown linkages of climate oscillations with climate extreme events, such as floods and droughts, which may induce risks in summer and winter crop productions. The goal of this study is to explore spatial and temporal variability of a summer crop (maize) and a winter crop (wheat) yields and its linkages with influential climate oscillations in the United States. The county level yield data over 1960–2016 for maize and winter wheat were aggregated into each of the 260 climate divisions in the rainfed regions of the United States, with the linear yield trend being removed. The rotated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reveals that the first five principal components explain 79% (maize) and 72% (winter wheat) of the spatial and temporal variability of crop anomalies. The first principal component of crop yield variability is strongly associated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The results of multiple linear regressions for predicting yield anomalies using climate indices show that, climate indices during the reproductive period of maize explained final yield better than the vegetation period (30% versus 26%), while climate indices for winter wheat during the dormant and reproductive growth periods are similar and not significant (25% versus 28%). Categorical yield forecasts using random forecast techniques show that the low (below 30th percentile) and high (above 70th percentile) yields are well predicted by climate indices. Spatially, AMO is identified as the most important predictor for maize in 46% climate divisions and for wheat in 33% climate divisions. The results from this study may contribute to understanding the risks of large-scale climate oscillations to local-scale crop production and improving crop yield predictions.}
