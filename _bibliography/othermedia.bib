  abstract = "{Climate influences crop productions mainly through precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, humidity, evapotranspiration, leaf wetness, soil moisture, and atmospheric gases or particles. It impacts crops through cumulative effects during planting, growing, and harvesting seasons, extreme events such as drought, heatwave, and extreme precipitation, or shaping ecological stressors (e.g., weeds, pests, and diseases) and management practices (e.g., planting, harvesting, irrigation, and fertilization). They are modulated by large-scale climate oscillations and anthropogenic global warming.}"
