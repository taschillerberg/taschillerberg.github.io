    abstract = "{Shifts of daily and long-term climate in crop production regions may threaten global food security. While consensus results have been reached regarding the impacts of temperature changes on crop yields over these regions, it is unknown how agriculture-significant climate conditions, as derived from daily weather, are changing and how these changes impact crop failure risks. In this study, we analyze the changes in twelve agroclimatic indices, as indicators of agriculture-significant climate condition, for four globally important staple crops: maize, rice, soybean, and wheat, as well as contributions of these indices to the changes in crop failures over global crop production regions from 1981 to 2016. We derive the agroclimate indices for each crop growing season at each grid point over global cropland, including last spring frost, climatological growing season length, the start of field operations, field conditions suitable for planting, in-season maintenance, field conditions suitable for harvest, growing degree days, growing season stress, growing season total precipitation, growing season dry days, first fall frost, and accumulated frost days. Daily gridded temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture from climate reanalysis and remote sensing are used to calculate the agroclimatic indices. We analyze trends and variations of the agroclimate indices for different breadbaskets and food insecure locations over global cropland and their impacts on crop failures using machine learning models. We will discuss the implications of our analysis to management decisions and adaptation strategies. }",

    abstract = "{Large-scale climate variability, through teleconnections, potentially contributes to crop yield variability both regionally and globally. Crop failures, which are partially due to climate variability, threaten global food security. Regions that produce a large supply of agriculture commodities can be more susceptible to crop failure, thus causing concern for global food security. The United States experiences several modes of large-scale climate circulations that contribute to climate variability: Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), North American Oscillation (NAO), El-Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Pacific-North American (PNA). Since many of the climate extreme events are associated with these modes of climate variability, they are potentially influencing risks of crop failure. The objective of this study is to assess climate-induced changes of annual crop failure risks for maize and winter wheat over 1960 to 2016. We assess the influence of large-scale climate circulations on the frequency of crop failure in the rainfed United States using a Bayesian approach. The crop failure for each climate division is defined as the lower 20$^{th}$ percentile of the de-trended annual yield for maize and winter wheat. We expect that there will be both a spatial and temporal pattern associated between crop failure and climate modes, based on the phases of different climate modes, seasonal timing, and crop types. A negative phase of AMO and PDO may cause crop failure in the Midwest and southeast United States by increasing drought conditions in these regions; while a positive ENSO may cause failure in the south and southeast. These findings have implications for understanding long-term changes in crop risks and the potential for improving seasonal forecasting in agriculture.}",

    abstract = "{An increase in the occurrence of heavy precipitation has been one of the most pronounced climate change signals for the central United States. We study this trend by using the RegCM4 regional climate model to dynamically downscale CMIP5 global projections for 1950-2099 over the CORDEX North America domain. We examine the robustness of the results by driving the regional model with two different global models, by performing simulations at both 50 km and 25 km grid spacing, and by using different convective parameterizations in RegCM4. The global models sample the range of climate sensitivity in CMIP5: HadGEM2-ES has the highest equilibrium climate sensitivity of the CMIP5 models, while GFDL- ESM2M has one of the lowest sensitivities. RegCM4 results show increases in heavy precipitation (> 50 mm/day) over the central United States for the period 1951-2005 similar to observed trends. This trend is predicted to accelerate so that by the end of the 21st century incidence of heavy precipitation increases by a factor of 2 to 3. The trend is robust in that it is produced regardless of the driving global model or the configuration of the regional model. Results also show a modest increase in the number of dry days and a marked increase in the number of long runs of dry days (16 or more consecutive dry days). The combination of heavier events and longer runs of dry days has implications for sectors such as agriculture and water quality. This research was sponsored by USDA NIFA under the Earth System Modeling program and as part of a regional collaborative project.}",
