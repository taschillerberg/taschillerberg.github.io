While consensus results have been reached regarding the impacts of temperature changes on crop yields over these regions, it is unknown how agriculture-significant climate conditions, as derived from daily weather, are changing and how these changes impact crop failure risks. In this study, we analyze the changes in twelve agroclimatic indices, as indicators of agriculture-significant climate condition, for four globally important staple crops: maize, rice, soybean, and wheat, as well as contributions of these indices to the changes in crop failures over global crop production regions from 1981 to 2016. We derive the agroclimate indices for each crop growing season at each grid point over global cropland, including last spring frost, climatological growing season length, the start of field operations, field conditions suitable for planting, in-season maintenance, field conditions suitable for harvest, growing degree days, growing season stress, growing season total precipitation, growing season dry days, first fall frost, and accumulated frost days. Daily gridded temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture from climate reanalysis and remote sensing are used to calculate the agroclimatic indices. We analyze trends and variations of the agroclimate indices for different breadbaskets and food insecure locations over global cropland and their impacts on crop failures using machine learning models. We will discuss the implications of our analysis to management decisions and adaptation strategies. }"

     abstract = "{Global warming is changing both daily weather and long-term climate. In a connected world, climate shifts in any breadbasket of the world, particularly at the daily timescale, can threaten global food security. While consensus results have been reached regarding the impacts of temperature changes on crop yields over these regions, it is not known how agriculture-significant climate conditions, as derived from daily weather, are changing and how are these changes contributing to the changes of crop yields. In this study, we analyze the changes in 11 agroclimate indices, as indicators of agriculture-significant climate conditions, for four globally important crops: maize, rice, soybeans, and wheat, as well as contributions of these indices  to the changes in crop yields over each breadbasket region during the past decades. We derive the agroclimate indices for each crop growing season at each grid point over the global cropland, including: last spring frost, growing season length, the start of field operations, field conditions suitable for plating, growing degree days, growing season stress, field  conditions suitable for harvest, first fall frost, accumulated frost days, growing season total precipitation, and growing season dry days. Daily gridded temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture from various sources are used for calculating these agroclimate indices. We will present trends and variations  of these agroclimate indices at different locations over the global cropland, their relative contributions to the crop yields over different breadbaskets of the world as revealed by machine learning models, and discuss potential strategies to intervene or harness these changes. Our observational analysis based on multiple daily agroclimate datasets includes sources of uncertainty in the impact assessments and informs tailored  climate adaptation strategies to ensure food security in a changing climate.}",
