The most recent publication "Changes in crop failures and their predictions with agroclimatic conditions: Analysis based on earth observations and machine learning over global croplands" from Tayler's Ph.D. work is available for reading online from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109620" target="blank">Agriculture and Forest Meteorology</a>. This work focused on classifying crop failures (maize, rice, soy, and wheat) and using machine learning methods (i.e., Random Forest) to determine which agroclimate indices predict crop failures for several global regions.
